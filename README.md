# LIDAR_Quantum_RTOS_Project
This repository will be structured around three core principles, with an emphasis on RTOS sensors optimization for LIDAR systems and quantum-based obstacle detection algorithms.

# Principle 1: RTOS Sensors with Zephyr for LIDAR Optimization
Folder Name: RTOS_Sensors_LIDAR

# Description: 
This folder focuses on optimizing LIDAR systems using RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems) with Zephyr in VSCode. The integration of RTOS allows for better management of laser systems for commercial applications, providing improved real-time data processing and control over LIDAR systems.
